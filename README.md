# Week_15_Project
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Group Project

Due Wednesday, Jan 12th, 2022
Code reviews will occur on this day.

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is a data integration process used to store data in a database so it can be used by others and create consistent results for analysis.


Requirements:
It is advised you use the same data source you used for your first project, but you are free to choose another API or data source.

You will need to work in your team of 2-3 people to complete the following:

Create a data model with at least two tables in lucidchart.

Create a DDL for each table and execute it programatically.

Load your data using psycopg2 or another module.

Make sure your code and the steps you have taken to load your data into the database are clearly outlined.


Deliverables:
You must submit a link to your group github repository with:

A jupyter notebook with all your ETL code in it. I suggest using psycopg2, but you are free to use any other libraries you find.

5-10 SQL queries that highlight how your tables work. You must use at least three joins. Include a comment for each one indicating what it is doing.

Be prepared to present on the process you went through. This should not take longer than 8 minutes. Your presentation will be in a code review, so please do not create a powerpoint. Instead, you will walk through what code things you learned when working on this project. Do NOT simply go through all your code in an exhaustive manner.


Guidelines for your notebook:
Write up a summary of each step you have gone through using markdown.
Code should be neat and well documented

Use a common repository for your team
